# Terraria

This project provides helm charts that can be used to deploy your Terraria server to a kubernetes
cluster. TShock and vanilla servers are supported.

The charts are very WIP and are subject to change.

## Usage

[Helm](https://helm.sh) must be installed to use the charts.
Please refer to Helm's [documentation](https://helm.sh/docs/) to get started.
